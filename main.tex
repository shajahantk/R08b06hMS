\section{Introduction}

Many living and non-living systems, as simple as single cells and
small droplets of liquid, can harness energy from the surroundings and
use it to propel themselves~\cite{rosing2005thermodynamics,
  dixit2023pathway}. The self-propelled motion of droplets often
mimics key characteristics of motion observed in unicellular
organisms, including the run and tumble behavior of bacteria, the
locomotion of amoebas, electrotaxis, magnetotaxis, and chemotaxis
effect observed in bacteria. For instance, a chemically oscillating
droplet exhibiting higher excitability demonstrates a run and tumble
motion \cite{suematsu2021spontaneous}, while droplets containing an
organic solvent and 2-hexyldecanoic acid can be directed by a pH
gradient \cite{cejkova2014dynamics}. Furthermore, the motion of
mercury droplets can be influenced by an electric field
\cite{hollo2021electric}. In a similar way, various nonliving systems
can replicate the behavior of biological entities, such as colloidal
particles moving in a \ch{H2O2} solution \cite{yao2012nanostructured,
  gao2013organized}. Additionally, solid particles or oil droplets can
be set in motion due to variations in interfacial tension
\cite{bánsági2013motion}. Moreover, oil or aqueous droplets may propel
themselves through the Marangoni effect \cite{toyota2009self,
  thutupalli2011swarming, suematsu2016oscillation}.  \todo[inline]{It
  would be interesting if we could comment on how these studies show a\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q_j} 
  parallel between biological behaviour and droplets}

One important class of chemically driven active droplets contains 
the the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. 
The BZ reaction is a nonlinear chemical oscillatory
reaction; in this reaction, oscillations can be observed in the form
of a color change. The internal chemical oscillations inside the BZ droplets 
drives the mechanical motion, converting chemical energy to mechanical energy.
Chemical oscillations in the BZ reaction can propagate in space as 
chemical waves, creating circular and spiral patterns~\cite{amrutha2022mechanism, amrutha2023theory, sebastian2024effect}.
Many studies have shown that such chemical waves can affect the 
direction and magnitude of the self-propelled motion in these droplets~\cite{back2023electrotaxis,suematsu2016oscillation}.

Recently, several research groups have investigated BZ reaction
droplets to understand self-propelled and run-and-tumble motions
\cite{suematsu2021spontaneous}, effect of external electric fields
\cite{back2023electrotaxis} and the interactions among droplets. This
behaviors commonly found in micro biological systems.  Oliver et
al.\cite{steinbock1998radius} were the first to prepare BZ droplets to
study the radius-dependent chemical oscillations within BZ
droplets. Since then, numerous studies have focused on the
self-propelled motion of BZ droplets in an oil medium
\cite{kitahata2011spontaneous, suematsu2016oscillation, kumar2021fast,
  suematsu2021spontaneous} and their interactions. These interaction
studies were conducted in capillary tubes \cite{delgado2011coupled,
  li2014combined} and in structured arrays
\cite{chang2018towards}. Within these interaction experiments, the
droplets were not free to move; they were compactly arranged and
separated by oil containing surfactants. In their studies, Delgado et
al. and Li et al. observed synchronization of chemical oscillations,
noting that while the oscillations start off out of phase, they
eventually synchronize. This synchronization is influenced by the
spacing of the droplets, the presence of malonic acid, and the
illumination conditions in the photosensitive BZ reaction. Similarly,
Chang et al. employed an array with a distinct structure, where the
chemical oscillation in one droplet initiated oscillations in adjacent
droplets, leading to observable chemical communication.

  please metion what each one has done and then cite them. See above}

In this paper, we investigate the interaction between two moving BZ
droplets within a medium of moonolein-squalane oil. Our findings
indicate that the interaction can be control based on the chemical
activity of each droplet. We observed that as the activity of the
droplets increases, the interaction time between the BZ droplets
decreases. Furthermore, when two droplets with varying levels of
activity come into contact, the interaction time is influenced more
significantly by the droplet with the higher activity.

\section{Methods}

We conducted experiments at room temperature, maintaining consistent
environmental conditions and the experimental setup throughout the
experiments. We prepared the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction with
chemical concentrations of the components were 0.48M - 0.96M sodium
bromide (\ch{NaBrO_3}), along with 0.5M of sulphuric acid\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q_j} 
(\ch{H_2SO_4}), 0.96M malonic acid (\ch{CH_2(COOH)_2}, and 0.97M
sodium bromide (NaBr). A 25mM ferroin indicator solution
([Fe$(phe)_3$]S$O_4$) was used as a metal catalyst for the BZ
reaction. The reaction was performed on a magnetic stirrer without
ferroin indicator, and we waited for the yellow reaction to become
colorless. After obtaining a colorless solution, the metal catalyst
ferroin indicator solution was added, and we again waited for the
first oscillation to occur. The time required to get the first
oscillation is reduced with the sodium bromate concentration. After
the first oscillation, a 2$\mu$L BZ droplet was pipetted out on a 10mM
monoolein-squalane oil medium in a 5cm diameter S-line petridish, to
investigate the self-propelled motion and interaction of the BZ
droplet.

The self-propelled motion and interaction of BZ droplets were recorded
using a CMOS camera, which was operated through LabVIEW software. We
adjusted the frame rate and pixel size of the images with the LabVIEW
program. The images were captured at a rate of five frames per second
and analyzed using ImageJ software and the OpenCV library in Python
program. The BZ droplets coordintes and average intensity of the
droplets recorded for the each frame. This experimental work involved
more than 300 droplets.

\section{Results}
% The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is a chemical oscillatory
% reaction. When we put Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction droplets quite
% separated from each other in a MO-Sq oil medium, all droplets move
% in a different direction. While moving randomly, droplets come
% together and show interesting collective dynamics. When droplets
% move in an sq-mo oil medium, bromination of monoolein occurs at the
% interface of the BZ droplet. The bromination of monoolein prevents
% droplet coalescence during close droplet interaction and stabilizes
% the droplet. In this experiment, we ensured that the number of BZ
% droplets was not too concentrated, and we also disregarded
% interactions involving more than two droplets.

When an oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction droplet is placed in
a 10 mM monoolein-squalane oil medium, the BZ droplet shows the self -
propelled motion on 2D surface of the petridish. The motion of the BZ
droplet was random. The self-propelled motion of the BZ droplet is
associate with chemical oscillations inside the BZ droplet and
interfacial tension around the droplet. Inside the BZ droplet droplet,
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction produces the \ch{Br^-} ions, which is
helpful in the BZ reaction for oscillation and these emitted \ch{Br^-}
ions also react with the monoolein present in the oil medium and
reduces the interafacial tension around the BZ droplet. Due to
reduction in interfacial tension around the BZ droplet, BZ droplet
moves from lower interfacial tension to higher interfacial tension.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Figurs/Combined_activity.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Activity of BZ Droplet with Sodium Bromate:}
      Figures a, b, and c are the trajectories of the single BZ
      droplet for the 0.48M, 0.72M, and 0.96M \ch{NaBrO_3}
      concentration, respectively. We observed that the BZ droplet
      changed the direction more frequently with an increase in
      \ch{NabrO_3}. To clarify this, we plot the frequency of
      oscillations inside the BZ droplet (d) and the number of times
      the direction changed from its straight path by the BZ
      droplet(e) as a function of \ch{NabrO_3}. Plot (d) presents the
      number of oscillations, which increases with the sodium bromate
      concentration. Plot(e) presents the number of times the droplet
      shows deviation from its straight path increases as the
      concentration of \ch{NaBrO_3} increases. Direction changed
      plotted for the 200s. Plot (f) presents the average speed of the
      BZ droplet. The speed of the droplet increases with sodium
      bromate. It denotes that the sodium bromate increases the
      activity of the BZ droplet.}
    \label{Activity}
\end{figure}

The sodium bromate serves as the source of \ch{Br^-} ions. In the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction droplets, the emission of \ch{Br^-}
ions rises with increasing concentrations of sodium bromate. We
conducted experiments on BZ droplets using sodium bromate at
concentrations between 0.48 M and 0.96 M. The rate of the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction was found to increased with the sodium
bromate concentration, which resulted in a higher frequency of
oscillations and an increase in \ch{Br^-} ion
concentration. Additionally, as the concentration of sodium bromate in
the BZ droplet increases, the speed of the droplets also increases. We
measured the speed of the BZ droplets over short time intervals and
averaged these measurements to determine their overall speed. It's
also observed that the continuous fluctuations in the direction of the
self-propelled motion of the BZ droplets increased with the sodium
bromate concentrations. In Figure \ref{Activity} we can observed that
the frequency of oscillations, directional fluctuations, and droplet
speed all increase with sodium bromate. This confirms that BZ droplets
exhibit higher activity at higher sodium bromate concentrations.

\par When BZ droplets are placed in a petri dish with a lower density
of droplets, they exhibit random movement. As they move, pairs of
droplets interact collectively. This notable collective behavior
occurs when the distance between their centers is 2.5 mm or
less. Within this range, the droplets influence one another. During
these interactions, droplets make contact with their edges and move
around each other, also both droplet moves by maintaining an
inter-droplet distance of 2.5 mm or less. Despite touching each
other's boundaries, coalescence does not occur due to the
bromomonoolein layer on the surface of the BZ droplets. In this study,
we investigated how the BZ droplets interact with varying the actvity
of droplet or concentrations of sodium bromate in BZ droplet. Figure
\ref{BZ Droplet Interaction Trajectory} illustrates the interactions
between two BZ droplets with different sodium bromate concentrations
at various times and positions.

    % When we put a single droplet in an SQ-MO oil medium with a lower

When two droplets come together, they show collective behavior, and
simultaneously, the bromination of monoolein happens around the
droplet. It leads to a decrease in interfacial tension around both BZ
droplets. After sufficient time, due to the lowering of interfacial
tension around both droplets, both droplets moved away from each
other. The inter-droplet distance between the droplets with time, as
shown in Figure \ref{Inter-Droplet Distance}. The red dotted line
presents the interaction time of the droplets when the inter-droplet
distance was 2.5mm or less.

\end{figure}

When the sodium bromate concentration increases, the fast interfacial
tension around the droplets decreases, resulting in a decrease in the
interaction time of the BZ droplets. In Figure
\ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit} (a), we can observe that the
interaction time of the BZ droplets decreased with the sodium
bromate. At the higher concentration of sodium bromate, the effect of
chemical wave propagation inside the droplet increased. The chemical
wave propagation inside the BZ droplet was very frequent, and the
orientation was random. When two interacting droplets, due to a
lowering in interfacial tension, move away simultaneously due to the
propagation of a chemical wave inside the droplets, they again come
together and show collective behavior. We can observe that in Figure
\ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit} (a), at higher sodium bromate
concentration, the reduction in interaction time was very small.
% When the two BZ droplets come together, they show collective
% motion. During this collective motion, bromine ions react with
% monoolein from the oil medium and reduce the interfacial tension in
% that region. Due to a lowering in interfacial surface tension, BZ
% droplets move away after some interval of time.  In acid medium
% \ch{NaBrO_3} produces the \ch{Br^-} ions.  When \ch{NaBrO_3}
% concentration increases, then the concentration of \ch{Br^-} ions
% also increases. Which increases the rate of monoolein
% bromination. Around BZ droplet quickly reduces the interfacial
% surface tension, and the droplet moves away.

    \caption{\textbf{Time Interval of Droplet Close Interaction:} Plot
      (a) is the interaction time of the same BZ droplets as a
      function of sodium bromate. The interaction time of the BZ

      interaction time for the two droplets with different
      concentrations of sodium bromate. In one droplet, the sodium

      other droplet varied. The interaction time of the BZ droplets
      decreases with the sodium concentration of the other
      droplets. At the higher concentration of sodium bromate in the
      other droplet, the change in interaction time was small.}
    \label{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit}
\end{figure}

We were also curious about the BZ droplets interaction with various
active behaviors. To investigate this, we examined the interaction
between a BZ droplet with a fixed sodium bromate concentration and
another droplet with varying concentrations of sodium bromate. We
observed similar results to those shown in Figure
\ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit} (a), where the interaction time
decreases as the sodium bromate concentration in the second BZ droplet
increases. The interaction time between the BZ droplets varies
depending on the droplet has the higher concentration of sodium
bromate.

% When we sequentially increased the concentration \ch{NaBrO_3}, the
% interfacial surface tension around the BZ droplet decreased fast,
% and the droplet moved away. But at higher concentrations of
% \ch{NaBrO_3}, the frequency of chemical wave propagation increased
% inside the droplet. The direction of chemical wave propagation was
% random. Due to the bromination of monoolein, the BZ droplet moves
% away, but at the same time, because of the chemical wave inside the
% droplet, both droplets try to move away but come close together and
% stay together for a sufficient time. Figure
% \ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit} (a) shows that in low concentration
% region of \ch{NaBrO_3} with a concentration of \ch{NaBrO_3} (\ch{T_2
% - T_1}) reduces but at higher concentration, because of chemical
% wave (\ch{T_2 - T_1}) was nearly constant. The close droplet
% interaction for the BZ droplet for the different chemical
% compositions of \ch{NaBrO_3} is shown in Figure
% \ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit}(b). In figure (b), the \ch{NaBrO_3}
% concentration of one droplet was 0.53M, and for the other droplet,
% 0.53M, 0.62M, 0.72, 0.84M, and 0.96M, respectively, to know the
% effect of the gradient of \ch{NaBrO_3} concentration on the close
% interaction of BZ droplet. Plot (b) shows the same behavior as
% observed in Figure \ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit}(a). In figure
% \ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit}(b), it is observed that the close
% interaction of BZ droplets depends on the BZ droplet, which has a
% higher concentration of \ch{NaBrO_3} than the lower concentration BZ
% droplet.  Similarly, we studied the interaction of BZ droplets of
% different volumes. We observed two different types of
% interaction. In Figure \ref{1&5_combined}, Plot (a) and (b) show the
% path following interaction. When a big droplet follows a small
% droplet, this interaction lasts for a long time. When two BZ
% droplets show interaction from opposite directions, or a small
% droplet follows a big droplet, then the interaction time of the
% droplets is small compared to the first type, as shown in Figure
% \ref{1&5_combined}. When a small BZ droplet follows the big droplet,
% the big droplet, which has a higher surface area, reduces the large
% interfacial surface tension in the path. Due to lower interfacial
% surface tension, small droplets following big droplet interaction
% will not sustain for a long time, as observed when a big droplet
% follows a small droplet.

      interaction had a higher time of interaction than plots a and
      b. }
    \label{Different_size}
\end{figure}

We also investigated how droplets of different sizes interact with one
another. We observed three distinct types of interactions based on how
the droplets approach each other. The droplets can either arrive from
opposite directions, move in parallel, or have a larger droplet trail
behind a smaller one. Due to its larger surface area, the bromination
rate of monoolein was higher in the larger BZ droplet, resulting in a
faster speed for the bigger droplet compared to the smaller one. When
a small droplet approaches from the opposite direction, or when both
droplets move parallel while maintaining a minimum separation, the
interaction time is shorter than when a larger droplet follows a
smaller one. In the case where the large droplet trails the small one,
its speed is suppressed by the smaller droplet, leading to a sustain
interaction for long time. These three interaction types can be seen
in Figure \ref{Different_size}.
\begin{figure}[H]

        Interactions:} The plots present the interactions of
      different-sized droplets with interaction time. The shaded
      region presents the fig \ref{Different_size}(a) and (b)
      interaction, when droplets arrive from opposite directions, or
      move parallel with minimum distance. The other part contained
      the interactions, which had an interaction time of 50 seconds or
      more. In this interaction region, a small droplet was always
      followed by a big droplet as observed in Figure
      \ref{Different_size}(c).}
    \label{Big-Small Droplet Interaction Time}
\end{figure}

When two droplets with different size approach from opposite
directions and move parallel to each other, their interaction time is
typically less than 50 seconds, as indicated in the shaded area of
Figure \ref{Big-Small Droplet Interaction Time}. Conversely, in other
sections of the figure, the interaction time exceeds 50 seconds when a
larger droplet trails a smaller one. When the smaller droplet follows
the larger on, the interaction time was negligible. The larger
droplet, moving at a higher When smaller droplet fallows the larger
droplet, larger droplet easily moved away of interaction and
interaction was not sustained. Additionally, when two droplets of
equal size interact, the time of interaction remains consistent
regardless of their approach sides. The collective interaction of the
BZ droplets was noted within a 2.5 mm or less distance between them,
specifically for BZ droplets with a diameter of 1.75 mm.

\section{Conclusion}
The self–propelled motion of the BZ droplet is associated with
chemical oscillations inside the droplet and the interfacial tension
around the BZ droplet. The sodium bromate concentration inside the BZ
droplet plays a vital role in the self-propelled motion of the BZ
droplet. The self-propelled motion of the BZ droplet, fluctuations
in the direction of motion, frequency of oscillations, and speed of
droplet increase as a function of sodium bromate. It confirmed that the
activity of the BZ droplet increases with the sodium bromate
concentration. In this experimental work, we explored the interaction
of BZ droplets as a function of sodium bromate. Two BZ droplets,
during self-propelled motion in a random direction, come together and
show the collective interaction behavior. This BZ droplet shows the
collective interaction and motion, with the inter-droplet distance of
around 2.5 mm or less. The interaction time of the BZ droplets
decreases with the sodium bromate. To explore the interaction of the
BZ droplet with different activities, we fixed the sodium bromate
concentration of one droplet and varied it in the other BZ droplet;
the interaction time decreases as the sodium concentration increases
in the other droplet. The interaction time of the droplets depends on
the droplet with higher sodium bromate. When two BZ droplets of
different sizes interact, three types of interactions are
observed. Two BZ droplets arrived from opposite directions, moved in
parallel, and the big droplet followed the small droplet. The first
two have the interaction time less than 50 seconds. When a big droplet
follows a small droplet, the interaction time is always higher. The
interaction time of the BZ droplet depends on the droplet with the
highest activity. Big droplet has higher activity, but when they
follow a small droplet, their activity gets suppressed, and the
interaction lasts for a long time.
\par Similarly, BZ droplet activity can be controlled by the sulphuric
acid of the BZ droplet. In acidic medium, sodium bromate produces
\ch{Br^-} ions. These \ch{Br^-} ions are helpful for the
self-propelled motion and oscillations of the BZ droplet. We observed
nearly the same result with sulphuric acid. The interaction time of
the BZ droplet decreases with the sulphuric acid. When two droplets
with different sulphuric acid concentrations interact, the interaction
time depends more on the sulphuric acid concentration of the droplet.

\par In this work, we explored the interaction of BZ droplets when
both droplets are sufficiently close. To know what forces attract the
droplet from a long distance, it is still not clear. We hope
our findings might help researchers to simulate the interaction of an
active system by considering the internal energy of the active system.
% The self–propelled motion of the BZ droplet is associated with
% chemical composition inside the droplet, and the interfacial tension
% around the BZ droplet. Inside the droplet, the BZ reaction produces
% Br- ions, which react with monoolein, which is present in an oil
% medium. Because of the bromination of monoolein, interfacial surface
% tension reduces, and the droplet moves from a lower interfacial
% surface tension to a higher interfacial surface tension. While
% moving randomly, two droplets come close and show collective
% behavior. In this work, we explore the close interaction of BZ
% droplets.  Due to the bromination of monoolein from both droplets,
% when the interfacial tension reduces sufficiently, the droplets move
% away from each other. The concentration of the sodium bromate
% increases the concentration of Br- ions, which leads to an increased
% rate of bromination of monoolein and a decrease in close interaction
% time (\ch{T12}). At higher concentrations of \ch{NaBrO_3}, the
% frequency of chemical oscillations increases. The direction of
% propagation of the chemical wave was random. When two droplets with
% higher concentrations were interacting because of interfacial
% surface tension, droplets tried to move away, but at the same time,
% because of chemical wave orientation, they came together and showed
% collective motion, even maintaining some minimum distance. With the
% sodium bromate concentration, close interaction time decreases, but
% at higher concentrations, due to chemical waves, it becomes nearly
% constant. Similarly, in a higher acidic medium, large Br- ions are
% produced in the BZ reaction, which increases the bromination of
% monoolein. The close interaction time of the BZ reaction is nearly
% reduced with \ch{H_2SO_4}.In the ballistic motion of the BZ droplet,
% the close interaction time interval was maximum, while in the random
% motion, the close interaction was lower compared to the ballistic
% motion. In different-sized droplets, when a big droplet is a small
% droplet, then it is for a long time, while other interactions last
% for a shorter time. Based on this study, we can infer that the
% internal chemical reactions significantly influence the collective
% movement of droplets in the presence of a chemical gradient. We
% anticipate that the close interactions within the active BZ droplet
% system will serve as a valuable model for investigating the
% interactions of biomimetic soft swimmers.
