\section{Introduction}
Many living and non-living systems, as simple as single cells, and
small droplets of liquid can harness energy from the surroundings and
use it to propel themselves~\cite{rosing2005thermodynamics,
  dixit2023pathway}. They use the sophisticated sensing mechanism for the selection 
of direction of motion, such as chemotaxis, thermotaxis, electrotaxis, magnetotaxis,
{\it etc.}~\cite{kumar2010physics,suarez2006sperm,wagner2024magnetotaxis,hokmabad2022chemotactic,buness2024electrotaxis}. 
Many active systems, including Janus particles, camphor boats, micro robots, and active droplets~\cite{gomez2016dynamics,heisler2012swarming, singh2025active} 
mimic the sensing and movement patterns found in the living world. 
For instance, the thymol acetate (TA) droplet exhibits a run-and-tumble motion, a movement 
pattern commonly observed in bacterial motion~\cite{fujino2025differentiation}. 
Lagzi and colleagues have shown that droplets containing an organic solvent and 2-hexyldecanoic 
acid can be directed by a pH gradient \cite{lagzi2010maze}. 
Similarly, differences in the salt concentration can drive an alcohol droplet~\cite{cejkova2014dynamics} 
in a sodium deconate solution. 
Hollo and colleagues have demonstrated that the movement of mercury droplets can be controlled by an electric field~\cite{hollo2021electric}.

One important class of chemically driven active droplets contains the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. The BZ reaction is a complex, nonlinear
chemical reaction characterised by cyclic
oscillations\cite{zaikin1970concentration,zhabotinsky1964periodical}.  It
consists of three main stages, each involving numerous sub-reactions. In the
first stage, there is a continuous consumption of bromide (\ch{Br^-}) ions. The
bromide ions combine with bromate (\ch{BrO_3^-}) in the presence of acid to
produce bromine (\ch{Br_2}). Once the concentration of bromide ions drops below
a certain level, the second stage begins. During the second stage, bromous acid
reacts with the catalyst, Ferroin, and oxidizes the \ch{Fe^{2+}} to
\ch{Fe^{3+}}, causing the reaction to turn blue. The second stage ends when
\ch{Fe^{3+}} concentration increases beyond a threshold. During the third
stage, \ch{Fe^{3+}} is reduced back to \ch{Fe^{2+}}, and bromide ions
increases.  As the levels of \ch{Br^-} ions rise sufficiently, the cycle
restarts with the first stage. The third stage essentially acts as a reset for
the entire reaction \cite{field1974oscillations} and the cycle repeats (figure~\ref{fig:BZ Droplet}).  
Thus, color oscillations indicate each stage of this oscillating reaction
(red to blue and black).  And these oscillations can propagate in space as
chemical waves, creating circular and spiral
patterns~\cite{amrutha2022mechanism,amrutha2023theory,sebastian2024effect}.

When we place a droplet of BZ reagents in an oily medium, the chemical
oscillations inside the BZ droplets drive the mechanical motion, converting
chemical energy to mechanical energy. Many studies have shown that such
chemical waves can affect the direction and magnitude of movement in these
droplets \cite{suematsu2016oscillation,back2023electrotaxis}.  Several research
groups have used the BZ reaction droplets to study the effects of external and
internal factors that affect the movement and the dynamics of multiple
droplets~\cite{back2023electrotaxis,suematsu2021spontaneous,kitahata2011spontaneous,kumar2021fast}.
Previous studies on the interaction were conducted in capillary
tubes~\cite{delgado2011coupled,li2014combined} and in structured
arrays~\cite{chang2018towards}, where the particles were compactly arranged and
separated by oil containing surfactants, which prevented them from merging.
They have observed that chemical oscillations can synchronise across droplets,
and droplets can communicate via chemical signalling.  Note that these droplets
were confined and could not move freely.

In this paper, we investigate the interaction between two moving BZ droplets
within a medium of moonolein-squalane oil. Our findings indicate that the
sodium bromate concentration can control the activity of the BZ droplet. As the
activity determined by sodium bromate concentration increases within a BZ
droplet, the interaction time between the two droplets decreases.  Furthermore,
when two droplets with varying levels of activity come into contact, the
interaction time is influenced more significantly by the droplet with the
higher activity.  We also study the movement patterns of droplets of different
sizes and catalogue three different kinds of binary interactions between
droplets.

\section{Methods}

The BZ reaction consists of three stages, each stage showing a different color, corresponding to the oxidation and reduction of the ferroin metal catalyst.}
	\label{fig:BZ Droplet}
\end{figure}

The chemical concentrations of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky stock solution 
are as follows:
0.96M malonic acid (\ch{CH_2(COOH)_2}), 0.97M sodium bromide (NaBr), 
0.5M sulphuric acid (\ch{H_2SO_4}), and
25mM ferroin indicator solution (\ch{[Fe(phe)_3]SO_4}) was used as a
metal catalyst and indicator. We varied the
sodium bromate (\ch{NaBrO_3}) concentration from 0.48M-0.96M. 
We mixed them using a magnetic stirrer, stirring continuously 
until chemical oscillation started. After the first oscillation, we placed 2$\mu$L of this mixture
into a 10mM monoolein-squalane oil medium inside a 5cm diameter S-line Petri dish.
The experiments were conducted at room temperature ($24^{\circ}$), 
maintaining consistent environmental conditions
throughout the experiments. 
\todo{indicate the source of chemicals}

Figure~\ref{fig: setup} shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup. 
The movement of the BZ droplets was recorded using a CMOS camera.
The images were captured at a rate of five frames per second
and analyzed using ImageJ software and the OpenCV library in Python. 
The spatial coordinates and average color intensity of the BZ
droplets were recorded for each frame. We have examined 
more than 300 droplets. 
Each experimental data set consists of an average of 10 interactions.

\end{figure}

We use the following parameters to characterise motion.
\subsubsection{Trajectory}
\todo{What algorithm is used to track droplets?} 
A typical trajectory is shown in figure~\ref{fig:setup}(b).
\subsubsection{Frequncy of oscillation}
We track the average intensity of moving BZ droplets as discussed in the
method. 
From this time series, we calculated the average frequency of chemical
oscillations inside the BZ droplet (see figure~\ref{fig:setup}(c)). 

\subsubsection{Direction fluctuation}
Additionally, we track how often the BZ droplet's path
fluctuated from its straight trajectory during the initial 200 seconds.
Although the BZ droplet trajectory was not very linear, we plotted the changes
in direction of the BZ droplet at angles greater than {$45^0$}. 

\subsubsection{Speed}
While moving the BZ droplet, we track the coordinate of
the BZ droplet for each frame. From this coordinate, we calculate the
instantaneous speed of the BZ droplet, then average these measurements to
determine the overall speed of the BZ droplet.

\section{Results}
% The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is a chemical oscillatory
% reaction. When we put Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction droplets quite
% separated from each other in a MO-Sq oil medium, all droplets move
% in a different direction. While moving randomly, droplets come
% together and show interesting collective dynamics. When droplets
% move in an sq-mo oil medium, bromination of monoolein occurs at the
% interface of the BZ droplet. The bromination of monoolein prevents
% droplet coalescence during close droplet interaction and stabilizes
% the droplet. In this experiment, we ensured that the number of BZ
% droplets was not too concentrated, and we also disregarded
% interactions involving more than two droplets.

%When an oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction droplet is placed in
%a 10 mM monoolein-squalane oil medium, the BZ droplet shows the self -
%propelled motion on 2D surface of the Petri dish. The motion of the BZ
%droplet was random. The self-propelled motion of the BZ droplet is
%associate with chemical oscillations inside the BZ droplet and
%interfacial tension around the droplet. Inside the BZ droplet droplet,
%Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction produces the \ch{Br^-} ions, which is
%helpful in the BZ reaction for oscillation and these emitted \ch{Br^-}
%ions also react with the monoolein present in the oil medium and
%reduces the interafacial tension around the BZ droplet \cite{suematsu2016oscillation}. Due to
%reduction in interfacial tension around the BZ droplet, BZ droplet
%moves from lower interfacial tension to higher interfacial tension.

A small droplet containing 2$\mu L$ of the  Belousov-Zhabotinsky reagents is
placed in a Petri dish filled with oily medium (figure~\ref{fig:setup}(a)), and
soon it starts moving on the 2D surface of the Petri dish. A typical trajectory
of the droplet is shown in  figure~\ref{fig:setup}(b). The self-propelled
motion of the BZ droplet is associated with chemical oscillations inside the BZ
droplet and interfacial tension around the droplet. The chemical oscillations
manifest as a color change in the droplet. We show the average light intensity
as a function of time in figure~\ref{fig:setup}(c). The chemical waves can also
be seen propagating from one end of the droplet (figure~\ref{fig:setup}(d)).

In this work, we measure the dynamics of the BZ droplet as a function of sodium
bromate. Increasing sodium bromate concentration increases the escitability of 
BZ reaction~\cite{???}. 
\todo{Cite; should we define excitability?}
Figure \ref{fig:activity}(a-c) shows the trajectory of the BZ droplet
at varying sodium bromate concentrations. As the sodium bromate concentration
increases in the BZ droplet, the droplet's trajectory becomes more complex. We
quantify the complexity of the movement using the frequency of oscillations
inside the droplet, fluctuations in the movement direction, and the speed of
the droplet.  We tracked the average color intensity of moving BZ droplets as
discussed in the method. From this time series, we can calculate the average
frequency of chemical oscillations. The frequency of chemical oscillations
increases with the sodium bromate concentration (figure~\ref{fig:activity}(d)).
In Figure \ref{fig:activity}~(e), it is visible that the fluctuation in
direction increases with sodium bromate. The instantaneous speed of the droplet
also increases with the sodium bromate concentration. Thus, we can control the
movement patterns of the BZ droplet by varying the sodium bromate
concentration.  In all these studies, the volume is fixed at \todo{Give
volume}.

	oscillations inside the BZ droplet (d), 
    	direction fluctuation (e) and the speed of the droplet increase

\end{figure}



When several BZ droplets are placed in a Petri dish,
Different BZ droplets move in different directions.
However, we observe that droplets come closer to other droplets and move around or 
move parallel for some time, and then move away (see Figure~\ref{fig:dropletDistance}).
The circular motion of one droplet around its pair is seen when
the inter-droplet distance (the distance between the centres of
droplets) is 2.5 mm or less (see supplementary videos). 
The bromo-mono-olein layer that forms around each droplet in the 
squalane-monolein medium can prevent the droplets from merging~\cite{thutupalli2011bilayer}.
We characterised this pairwise interaction by measuring the total time during which the two droplets 
stay in proximity. The interaction time is measured as the time interval during which the inter-droplet 
distance is below 2.5 mm (Figure~\ref{fig:dropletDistance}).

    % When we put a single droplet in an SQ-MO oil medium with a lower

We measure the interaction time of the two BZ droplets as a function of sodium
bromate concentration. First, we study the interaction of two chemically
identical BZ droplets, in which both interacting BZ droplets have the same
sodium bromate concentration.  Figure \ref{fig:dropletDistance}(d), blue bars
(marked A) indicate the interaction time of identical BZ droplets. This time
decreases with the sodium bromate concentration. We also measured the
interaction time of the BZ droplets when the sodium bromate concentrations were
different in them. We fixed the sodium bromate concentration in one BZ droplet
and varied the concentration in the second droplet. In Figure
\ref{fig:dropletDistance}(d), the red bars (marked B) show the variation of
interaction time when sodium bromate concentration is varied only in the second
droplet. We note that the mean interaction time decreases with sodium bromate;
however, the change is less compared to A.  It indicates that when BZ droplets
with different levels of excitability ( {\it i.e.,} with different sodium bromate
concentrations) interact, the interaction time depends on the BZ droplet with
the higher excitability or sodium bromate concentration.
\todo{check the statement- do we have enough proof ?}
\todo{What is the size/volume?}

% When the two BZ droplets come together, they show collective
% motion. During this collective motion, bromine ions react with
% monoolein from the oil medium and reduce the interfacial tension in
% that region. Due to a lowering in interfacial surface tension, BZ
% droplets move away after some interval of time.  In acid medium
% \ch{NaBrO_3} produces the \ch{Br^-} ions.  When \ch{NaBrO_3}
% concentration increases, then the concentration of \ch{Br^-} ions
% also increases. Which increases the rate of monoolein
% bromination. Around BZ droplet quickly reduces the interfacial
% surface tension, and the droplet moves away.

 %   \label{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit}
%\end{figure}

%We were also curious about the BZ droplets interaction with various
%active behaviors. To investigate this, we examined the interaction
%between a BZ droplet with a fixed sodium bromate concentration and
%another droplet with varying concentrations of sodium bromate. We
%observed similar results to those shown in Figure
%\ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit} (a), where the interaction time
%decreases as the sodium bromate concentration in the second BZ droplet
%increases. The interaction time between the BZ droplets varies
%depending on the droplet has the higher concentration of sodium
%bromate.

% When we sequentially increased the concentration \ch{NaBrO_3}, the
% interfacial surface tension around the BZ droplet decreased fast,
% and the droplet moved away. But at higher concentrations of
% \ch{NaBrO_3}, the frequency of chemical wave propagation increased
% inside the droplet. The direction of chemical wave propagation was
% random. Due to the bromination of monoolein, the BZ droplet moves
% away, but at the same time, because of the chemical wave inside the
% droplet, both droplets try to move away but come close together and
% stay together for a sufficient time. Figure
% \ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit} (a) shows that in low concentration
% region of \ch{NaBrO_3} with a concentration of \ch{NaBrO_3} (\ch{T_2
% - T_1}) reduces but at higher concentration, because of chemical
% wave (\ch{T_2 - T_1}) was nearly constant. The close droplet
% interaction for the BZ droplet for the different chemical
% compositions of \ch{NaBrO_3} is shown in Figure
% \ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit}(b). In figure (b), the \ch{NaBrO_3}
% concentration of one droplet was 0.53M, and for the other droplet,
% 0.53M, 0.62M, 0.72, 0.84M, and 0.96M, respectively, to know the
% effect of the gradient of \ch{NaBrO_3} concentration on the close
% interaction of BZ droplet. Plot (b) shows the same behavior as
% observed in Figure \ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit}(a). In figure
% \ref{H2SO4+NaBrO3_Combined_fit}(b), it is observed that the close
% interaction of BZ droplets depends on the BZ droplet, which has a
% higher concentration of \ch{NaBrO_3} than the lower concentration BZ
% droplet.  Similarly, we studied the interaction of BZ droplets of
% different volumes. We observed two different types of
% interaction. In Figure \ref{1&5_combined}, Plot (a) and (b) show the
% path following interaction. When a big droplet follows a small
% droplet, this interaction lasts for a long time. When two BZ
% droplets show interaction from opposite directions, or a small
% droplet follows a big droplet, then the interaction time of the
% droplets is small compared to the first type, as shown in Figure
% \ref{1&5_combined}. When a small BZ droplet follows the big droplet,
% the big droplet, which has a higher surface area, reduces the large
% interfacial surface tension in the path. Due to lower interfacial
% surface tension, small droplets following big droplet interaction
% will not sustain for a long time, as observed when a big droplet
% follows a small droplet.

    \label{Different_size}
\end{figure}

We also investigated how droplets of different sizes interact with one another.
We observed three distinct types of interaction based on how the droplets
approach each other. The droplets can either arrive from opposite directions,
move in parallel, or have a larger droplet trail behind a smaller one (see
figure \ref{Different_size}a, b, c, respectively).  The speed of droplets
depends on the size~\cite{???}.  \todo{Is there a reference for size
dependence? Can we add a figure?} Larger BZ droplets move than the smaller BZ
droplets. The interaction time is highest when a large droplet follows a small
one (as in figure \ref{Different_size}~c).  The speed of the large droplet is
suppressed by the smaller droplet, leading to a sustained interaction for a
long time (figure \ref{Different_size}). In other situations (figure
\ref{Different_size}~a and b), the interactions are shorter. The interaction
times in three different patterns of movement are shown in
figure~\ref{fig:Big-Small}.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
In this paper we have presented experimental studies of interaction 
between two chemically active droplets. We studied the interaction as a 
function of excitability (by varying sodium bromate concentration) and 
the size of the droplet. \todo{It would be nice to include the effect of size variation}.
We have shown that the fluctuations
in the direction of motion, frequency of oscillations, and speed of
droplet increase as a function of sodium bromate.
We quantified the interaction as the interaction time, the time when both droplets spent in 
close proximity. In most cases the droplets come together pair-wise and go around each other.
The interaction time decreases with excitability in either or both droplets.

It is well known that the chemical oscillations inside the BZ droplet
and the interfacial tension around the BZ droplet causes the
self-propelled motion of the BZ droplet. The change in interfacial
tension around the BZ droplet is influenced significantly by the
surfactant monoolein. The \ch{Br^-} ions produced in the BZ droplet
react with monoolein from the oil medium, and this bromination of
monoolein reduced the interfacial tension around the BZ droplet. Sodium bromate is a source of \ch{Br^-} ions in the BZ reaction. With higher concentrations of sodium bromate, the BZ reaction produced a
large number of \ch{Br^-} ions. When the sodium bromate concentration
increases in the BZ droplet, the rate of bromination of monoolein
increases around the surface of the BZ droplet, and as a result, the speed of the BZ droplet increases \cite{suematsu2021spontaneous}.
In the interaction of two BZ droplets moving in different directions, they come together and interact. How they detect each other from a long distance is unclear. When the two BZ come close, then they interact; their interaction sustains
until the surrounding interfacial tension is reduced
sufficiently. After the sufficient reduction of interfacial tension around both the BZ droplets, they move away from each other. When the sodium bromate concentration increased in the
BZ droplets, the rate of reduction in interfacial tension around BZ
droplets increased due to the bromination of surfactant monoolein from the
oil. As a result, the interaction time of the BZ droplet decreased
with the sodium bromate concentration.

 The interaction time of
the droplets depends on the droplet with the higher sodium bromate concentration. When
two BZ droplets of different sizes interact, three types of
interactions are observed. Two BZ droplets arrived from opposite
directions, moved in parallel, and the big droplet followed the small
droplet. The first two have the interaction time less than 50
seconds. When a big droplet follows a small droplet, the interaction
time is always higher. The interaction time of the BZ droplet depends
on the droplet with the highest excitability. The big droplet has a higher
speed, but when they follow a small droplet, it's movement is  
blocked by the slower, smaller droplet ahead, and they stay 
closer for long. Consequently, the interaction time is longest in 
such cases.

The excitability can also be controlled by the sulphuric
acid in the BZ droplet. In an acidic medium, sodium bromate produces
\ch{Br^-} ions. These \ch{Br^-} ions are helpful for the
self-propelled motion and oscillations of the BZ droplet. 
We observed
nearly the same result with sulphuric acid as we observed with sodium bromate. The interaction time of
the BZ droplet decreases with the sulphuric acid. When two droplets
with different sulphuric acid concentrations interact, the interaction
time depends more on the sulphuric acid concentration of the droplet.

These results contribute to 
the understanding of emergent collective behavior in chemically 
driven active matter systems, providing fundamental insights into 
how internal chemical processes govern external mechanical interactions.

%To know what forces attract the
%droplet from a long distance, it is still not clear. We hope
%our findings might help researchers to simulate the interaction of an
%active system by considering the internal energy of the active system.
% The self–propelled motion of the BZ droplet is associated with
% chemical composition inside the droplet, and the interfacial tension
% around the BZ droplet. Inside the droplet, the BZ reaction produces
% Br- ions, which react with monoolein, which is present in an oil
% medium. Because of the bromination of monoolein, interfacial surface
% tension reduces, and the droplet moves from a lower interfacial
% surface tension to a higher interfacial surface tension. While
% moving randomly, two droplets come close and show collective
% behavior. In this work, we explore the close interaction of BZ
% droplets.  Due to the bromination of monoolein from both droplets,
% when the interfacial tension reduces sufficiently, the droplets move
% away from each other. The concentration of the sodium bromate
% increases the concentration of Br- ions, which leads to an increased
% rate of bromination of monoolein and a decrease in close interaction
% time (\ch{T12}). At higher concentrations of \ch{NaBrO_3}, the
% frequency of chemical oscillations increases. The direction of
% propagation of the chemical wave was random. When two droplets with
% higher concentrations were interacting because of interfacial
% surface tension, droplets tried to move away, but at the same time,
% because of chemical wave orientation, they came together and showed
% collective motion, even maintaining some minimum distance. With the
% sodium bromate concentration, close interaction time decreases, but
% at higher concentrations, due to chemical waves, it becomes nearly
% constant. Similarly, in a higher acidic medium, large Br- ions are
% produced in the BZ reaction, which increases the bromination of
% monoolein. The close interaction time of the BZ reaction is nearly
% reduced with \ch{H_2SO_4}.In the ballistic motion of the BZ droplet,
% the close interaction time interval was maximum, while in the random
% motion, the close interaction was lower compared to the ballistic
% motion. In different-sized droplets, when a big droplet is a small
% droplet, then it is for a long time, while other interactions last
% for a shorter time. Based on this study, we can infer that the
% internal chemical reactions significantly influence the collective
% movement of droplets in the presence of a chemical gradient. We
% anticipate that the close interactions within the active BZ droplet
% system will serve as a valuable model for investigating the
% interactions of biomimetic soft swimmers.

When two droplets with different sizes approach from opposite
directions and move parallel to each other, their interaction time is
typically less than 50 seconds, as we can observe in Figure \ref{fig:Big-Smal}. Conversely, the interaction time exceeds 50 seconds when a
larger droplet trails a smaller one. When the smaller droplet follows
the larger one, the interaction time is negligible. The larger
the droplet is moving at a higher speed. When a smaller droplet follows the larger droplet, the larger droplet easily moves away from interaction, and interaction is not sustained. We have recorded a total of 53 interactions for the different-sized droplet interactions. We observed 22 percent parallel droplet motion. In 45 percent of the interactions, droplets arrived from opposite directions, while in 32 percent of the interactions, a pattern of falling droplets followed the interaction. Additionally, when two droplets of
equal size interact, the time of interaction remains consistent
regardless of their approach sides.

The self–propelled motion of the BZ droplet is associated with
chemical oscillations inside the droplet and the interfacial tension
around the BZ droplet. The sodium bromate concentration inside the BZ
droplet plays a vital role in the self-propelled motion of the BZ
droplet.  It confirmed that
the activity of the BZ droplet increases with the sodium bromate
concentration.
In this experimental work, we explored the interaction
of BZ droplets as a function of sodium bromate. Two BZ droplets,
during self-propelled motion, move in a random direction, come
together, and show the collective interaction behavior. This BZ droplet
shows the collective interaction and motion, with the inter-droplet
distance of around 2.5 mm or less. The interaction time of the BZ
droplets decreases with the sodium bromate concentration. To explore
the interaction of the BZ droplet with different activities, we fixed
the sodium bromate concentration of one droplet and varied it in the
other BZ droplet; the interaction time decreases as the sodium
concentration increases in the other droplet.
